Aryadipto,"Can't say I'm an audiophile, but the bass on this is impeccable.",5,"One of most well fitting headphones I've ever purchased, still, your ears might hurt after long hours of usage.I have taken good care of this, and haven't used it extensively, so after 1 year(or so) of usage, it's with me without a scratch. So far, I have only watched movies, but man, the sound in this is good.Played some games, eg. Albion online and Honkai Impact 3 wearing these and it was a really fun experience.10/10 for a casual gamer like me. I can't say for hardcore gamers."
Vishal Vir Singh,it is fabolous,4,"it is phenomenal but does not have a point port to connect, it has a normal mouse type connectivity to keyboard."
Kumar,OKAY FOR ONLINE CLASS NOT FOR MUSIC,4,I bought this for two reason. 1. ONLINE CLASS. 2. LISTENING SONGPerfectly all right for online class.I though this will give more bass unfortunately simply serio device. It's having more settings but no special result. So I can't suggest this for music lovers.
Pankaj Mahajan,Looks good but isn't very durable.,4,"The headphone is well built - I haven't exposed it to unexpected torture tests - that end the life of other wired headphones (sharp accidental tugs, which break the internal soft wires on other headphones). I hope the corded wires will withstand substantially more force. The noise cancellation is passive but good - does not block loud noises but the little things are blocked out. Microphone has been reported to be good - by people on the other side of the call. The mic boom is flexible - but not sure how long it will remain adjustable. I kinda expect it to lose it's ability to hold position after prolonged use - but that remains to be seen. So far quite happy. One thing I was slightly not happy about is that the ring that form the top of the headphone... the ""springs"" are actually quite thin and what you see is actually flexible plastic tubes that are covering the spring. Technically there is likely nothing wrong with this but it is just something that appears to be one thing but is something else. To be fair, if they were solid springs, the headset would be quite heavy - so I am also glad it isn't solid metal.I have yet to experience ear discomfort as other reviewers have complained - but the head band can rub your scalp if you put it on and take it off too often. Maybe because of the shape of my head (Large), the weight is on the scalp and not on the ears. So this could be different from person to person.Update after using the headset for a yearThe cushions are no longer firm, the faux leather covers are torn from minimal contact. The electronics and sound are still good. Cable is good, but the user interface is tattered up. Will try to fix it with cloth cover. Wish they used more durable material or provided way for user to replace the ear cushions"
Habeeb Al-deen,Simply Amazing..,5,Just go for it!!!
Bharath,I don't hate it. But not necessarily love it too..,4,"Long wire is great, but overly gaming aesthetic is a little cumbersome. It's HUGE to put on anybody's head. This is coming from a big head like me. Word of advice.. Never install boat software if you already have Nvidia hd audio drivers installed. My ears almost exploded with it's ""7.1 surround"" sound. Dialogues were hardly audible and gunshots were punching into my brain while that piece of crap was installed. Had to manually remove drivers from device manager to get it play nice with my games. All the discomforts were present as well. Heavy to the point where you have to get used to it? YES. Completely encase ears and make your ears sweaty? YES. Don't want to eat microphone for breakfast lunch and dinner? TOO BAD.. this gooseneck tube is the least rigid microphone fixture I have used so far not just for mic, but for anything. My bathroom bidet tube is more rigid than this one. The strength i think actually comes from the outer rubber tubing on the tube. It almost feels like they knew its not strong, so they just put a rubber tube over the gooseneck tube to compensate. All in all I got this for cheap so I can't complain too much."
Abner,DETAILED REVIEW AFTER A YEAR!!!!,4,"THERE'S ALWAYS ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENTS!!!IT WORKS! It Still works the Same as the day I bought it. Except for that one acute buzzing sound on the left side if you go above 90% Volume! But i think Most people will stay on 70% because that's sufficient for Gaming and Other Uses.PROS‚Ä¢ GREAT DESIGN and BUILD QUALITY. Feels Soft on your ears and the Area around it and the Headband thing is a Very Good Feature. (Dropped it a few times, no Scratches) Also doesn't feel Heavy after prolonged Usage (Even for 5+ hours)‚Ä¢ Okayish Software, with multiple fun controls to have for a Headphone at this price point.‚Ä¢ Good Thumping Bass, while keeping it Clear enough to not get clipped. it actually Vibrates your Ears. (Pun Intended)‚Ä¢ Good Mic Quality, almost silent until you start speaking. Pretty GOOD for Discord, Meetings etc. (Play around with the Mic settings in the Software, to get what you want based on your Surroundings)CONS‚Ä¢ NO DETACHABLE MIC. Sucks that the Mic is always there, while i mostly use it to Listen to Songs.‚Ä¢ WIRE TOO LONG. could've been a bit smaller.VERDICTSo a year back, this felt like a pretty good Purchase and Bang for the Buck. Got it for around 1700!Still sounds the same, earcups are as new it is. For a person who uses the Headphones almost 8+ hours a Day, im pretty surprised that the Earcups are still Good."

KAZURI,Good,5,Best
Siparna Paul,THE BASS AND MORE ONE,4,"The sound quality is very good. But the bass is too much light and everybody can listen from beside what you're listening. Overall product quality and sound quality both are great, you can go with this item. But you have to compromise for the bass. BoAt should work on it."
Shai,"Best Quality , Worth the Price",5,Best Budget Headphone so far. Was not expecting it to be good for that price.
surajbisoi,The product was already opened,4,"The media could not be loaded.
                



¬†Quite heavy8 out of 10I got it at 999 rupees"
Amazon Customer,Its ok,4,"Its okay. Nothing great, but not bad either. The mikes keeps staying erect by the materials nature"
Vignesh,Heavy weight,4,It's too heavy weight...otherwise performance good....so we could not use it for long time
kevin,Decent for the price,4,"Very comfortable and good sound quality but ....The material around the earphone has started to come undone and is very messy. But I've been using it for almost a year now so you could chalk it up to age.Other than that, worth it. No problems whatsoever."
Krishna Vasu,Amazing budget gaming headphone with negligible drawbacks,4,"The media could not be loaded.
                



¬†The only 2 problems I have with this are the fact that the microphone is basically fixed and you can't move it very much and it's always in your face, and the fact that you have to connect it via usb and not audio jack. Everything else is really good and it's a steal for the price if gaming is the main purpose , because, like most gaming headphones, music doesn't feel that great. But all in all, a really good deal for a pretty nice pair of headphones. The boat logo also has rgb lighting which randomly changes colour, which is also a pretty neat feature"
Priyansh Jain,Perfect Headset,5,I have been using this product for 2 years and still working perfectly. Great for gaming as it has clean sound you can hear clear footsteps gun-sounds etc.
Gazi Sifat,"Product is Good, should have mic mute button available.",4,"Headphones are great, WFH guys can buy it too, only thing missing is Mic mute button, and breathing boat icon on each side is ok but should have been provided with a button to keep it on or off according to one's preference. It remains on and might consume battery when not needed. Other than that it's a nice product without any doubt."
Prime,First impressions with Sound review updated.(Value for Money),5,"Sound Update :1. In Game, Mic quality is very good. People on other end can hear me very clearly & effectively.2. In Game, Sound is very clear and footsteps is very clearly audible from a far distance.3. While surfing on internet, watching videos on YouTube, songs, Bass quality is quite nice. It's not a very loud bass, it's a classic Bass. Volume is also pretty good.There is extra knob on one side of headset to increase and decrease master volume irrespectively of your computer sound.4. 50mm drivers can be downloaded from Boat website I'M 200 product page & it is a simple window to manage sound of left and right and control master volume.Also one great thing about these headphones are it's""Noise Cancellation "" - Once you plug in these headphones, you get disconnected from the outer world, it's like you and your sound only.------------------Fitting review :1. It covers full head and after 3 4 hrs it sweats bit, I sweat alot still sweat proportion was low.2. Fit is very tight on ears and very sturdy.3. Cushions are soft so ears doesn't pain.5. Not much heavy.-------------------In my opinion they are Value for money under 1500rs.--------------------First Impressions review :1. Build Quality is very good.2. Cable is braided & strong.3. Medium weight .4. Cushions are soft and covers whole ears.5. Mic has metallic braiding.Note : Sound review updated."
pooja,Value for money - yes. Best 7.1 channel headphones - yes.,4,"The sound clarity is crisp and let's one hear enemies with exact distance and direction. The RGB is beautiful and the design is wonderful.The only issue is that it has no custom app to manage RGB, equaliser and configure mic and sound for Linux and Mac OS. It's plug and play so most features like 7.1 channel and RGB work without needing to use the application but not having an option to do that on a Linux or a Mac is very disappointing. There is also no replacement ear pads and the ear pads will degraded due to swear in a few months. Also there are no RGB ring light like the ones shown in the advertiserary photos. Only the boat logo lights up which isn't disappointing but certainly deceptive. Also the mic is a bit too close to the face which feels kind of awkward. Overall 4/5."
Debasish Acharya,Its okay product,4,Though I received the product with a seal broken I had doubts about whether it will function or not. It is functioning well till now. Not for music lovers. The driver for this headset wasn't available in the boat store that they recommended to download. It is best used for office calling as noise cancellation is very good.
Customer,Not the first choice for gaming,4,"The headphones are not adjustable according to the size of your head so it pains your ears after wearing for sometime. The microphone does not cancel noise in close proximity even after doing all the necessary settings. The sound is good but not too clear on the scale of bass, base, etc."
Tobin George,Good quality but some things lacks,4,"Premium product, excellent quality but i was expecting below items:1) There is not mute control on headset2) THE RGB LED ON OFF BUTTON SHOULD BE PRESENT, BECAUSE IF YOU ARE CONNECTING THIS TO USB HUB(WITHOUT EXTERNAL POWER) THIS HEADSET CAN CAUSE PROBLEM IN EARPIES, SOME CRACKING SOUND WILL BE HEAR DUE TO SOME VOLTAGE THINGS, I THINK"
Consumer,Ridiculously high quality at a reasonably price,5,"To be honest, I am not a gamer but a musician. I was looking for a USB headset which also had a microphone, so that I could attend to video calls as well. My old Fingers USB headset had rather poor sound quality.I did not know what to expect from this brand called Boat, but once I put on the headset and listened to my favorite music, I was very impressed by the sound quality (bass / mids / highs). The volume level was also quite adequate. So as a music headset, this receives 5 stars from me.About the microphone - it seems to be producing noise of it's own. If you move the mic closer to your mouth, the noise is not so noticeable compared to your voice. However, it now begins to pick up breathing sounds and plosives from the mouth as well. The sponge over the mic is not a pop filter, but a wind cut filter (for the windy outdoors). But I am sure that with a little adjustment, and trial and error, an optimum mic-to-mouth-to-nose position can be achieved.There is a volume control on the left side (which controls the volume of both sides), and this volume control is not digital (it does not move the volume slider on the device). But it is ""fit for purpose"" all the same.I don't really care about the breathing LED lights, and there presence is completely inconsequential to me.So at this price (limited time deal price of Rs. 1299/-), I am thrilled with this product."
Saeesh N.,Good product but CANT WEAR EYEGLASSES,4,"overall a very good product, nice build but the biggest problem I faced is I can't wear my eyeglasses with this which I use for gaming. it hurts on the side and is not wearable at all.so if you wear glasses you might wanna skip this one."
Fowad A.K,BEST HEADPHONES FOR 1500RS,5,1- SOUND-The sound quality is very good considering its just 1500rs and most normal headphones you can find them at around 1000rs if u spend just a little more u get very good quality  and are very good for fps games and also racing games like when i play F1  CONS  - The sound lacks bass but that's what u expect from gaming headphones they are made for things like this but if want more bass like me a hardcore music listener just use the eq feature in boat software ITS GOOD and gives good customizability2-Build quality-Bulid quality is very good its sturdy and and feels well put together and the rgb is good also it has a mesh design in front of the rgb which its not showcased in the ads and in also the box3-7.1 SURROUND SOUND-The surround sound is very good and really involves u in movies or music that support it or are made for it also if your motherboard does not support 7.1 then idk what will happen because i haven't tested it on anything else4-MIC-The mic quality is very good only complain being its not detachable BUT HEY THATS WHAT U EXPECT FOR 1500RS5-TOTAL ROUNDUP- If you want the best headphones in this price range u should definitely go for it. There are really not a many things i can fault it for its very good for the priceRATINGSSOUND QUALITY- 8/10COMFORT- 10/10BUILD QUALITY- 9.5/10MIC- 7/10FOR THE PRICE OF 1500RS COMPLETE 10/10 SCORE BEST IN MY OPINONLastly i would like to say that when i opened the amazon box i got a heart attack when i saw the seal of the headphones was open from both the sides but thankfully there was no damage or anything and was open but had dust all over it i think it was directly open kept in the warehouse of the seller so a bit bad experience with the seller but the headphones it self was very goodso 5 stars for headphones and 3 stars for the seller
Suyog Parab,Purchased it for Teams meeting,4,Pros :1. Comfort to ears.2. Excellent build quality & especially the wire.3. Volume up-down buttonCons:1. No Mike mute button2. Led lights with a boat symbol on the sides.3. Slightly bigger as compared to the pictures shown.
Akash negi,Nice product,4,"The product was purchased a few days ago. The first time I received a defective one, the sound is lagging. I got a replacement, but I'm not satisfied with its fit and finish. Eras cushioning is good, though. When used for a long time, it feels a bit heavy. The microphone and noise cancellation work quite well. With the support of 7.1 surround sound, the sound quality is fine when gaming and listening to music. When compared to other brands in this price range, these headphones are impressive. However, maybe you should wait until there is a sale when the price is lower, then you can buy them. Also, there are grills on the side of them that are not shown in the product image."
Suprovat misra,it was the best for me,4,sounds great mic output could be better but that has nothing to do with amazonin a budget this is bestttttt
Samar Das,10 out of 10,5,"it was come on such a huge packet, 10 out of for product safty. My head phone is working perfectly fine, the sound quality is studio level, and the noise cancellation mic mic is very good at removing breathing noise but it's very sensitive, even sounds of our house can be captured üòÇ"
aditya_chaubey___,Good,4,Value for money product.
WaveOptic,Decent,3,"Quick summary time,pros-1) light weight.2) mic is very clear.3) decent build.4) the ear cups are soft.I sweat a lot, but wearing these, the sweat near the band and my ears was negligiblecons-1) the lights aren't in sync, you'll prolly need to download the app for it.2) the cable is too stiff, it needs hard pulling to straighten up, if not done correctly it starts to wind it self up.3) passive noise reduction is a joke.4) the mic can't be placed in any position, i.e if the angle is too extreme the mic goes back to a certain position.5) for laptop users- kindly go to your laptop settings and from there disable inbuilt laptop mic, games like valorant will glitch up sometimes and choose the inbuilt laptop mic rather than the headphones one, so if u disable the inbuilt mic, it works perfectly.6) the red wire attachment which comes out of the headphones seems flimsy, try not to pull too hard on it.overall it's an decent gaming headset, if you have the budget go for hyperx, if your budget is 2k then go for redgear comet, if not, then go for these boat ones."

RKN,a BIG massive size gaming headphones! good quality!,4,Well I have to agree that I did not have any idea this would be very big in size!Fully covers the ears. (so prepare for sweating)performance I am yet to see.But on first experience. The sound was loud and flat. Not for the musical listening I guess.build quality and material are very decent and good.rotary volume control on the headset. (no other controls)I bought this for online calls and now I understand this is not for the purpose.They manufacture says Cleary it is for gaming purpose.so it is our choice.!But for this price....this quality and design is awesome! absolutely!I will update later after usage.
Ramteja,Can't find anything good than this in this price range.,5,I bought it for just 1300. It serve all its purpose perfectly. Nothing to complain about. But i found the size is pretty big after receiving the product.. bit difficult while carrying.
Aadil hussain Padder,Best for me,5,"I order this product as im a video editor and does not use for gaming...Its mic is also good for recordingExcellent noise cancellation..But it should not be used with full sound, i sat it on stand and full room can hear it's sound.."
Arpan Mukherjee,Heavy Headphones.,4,This product weighs 350g which is according to me a little heavy so had difficulty for longer gaming hours.
Rajat Singh,"One of the best Gaming Headphones, Just go for it",5,"The media could not be loaded.
                



¬†Pros:1. Solid Build Quality, by a glance u can tell it's a great headphone2. Sound Quality is superb, perfect balance of treble and bass3. Mic is good, super flexible along with a durable metal cover4. There's a volume knob on the headphone which works separately without interacting to computer's volume5. Boat Plugins App is bonus with all the features packed settings6. Strong braided cables7. RGB boat logo8. Ears cuffs are also soft (not memory foam but still comfortable)Cons:1. Noise cancellation of mic is okayish2. Headphone is not that good in cancelling environment noises while listening3. Your ears will sweat because of the earcuffs in long sessions and sometimes may also cause discomfort to ears4. Since it's a USB headphone, it is limited to PCs (I checked that it is giving OTG support on android, but it's a hassle using dongles)FINAL VERDICT: If you are a gamer and want a headphone with good built and sound quality, along with good brand service...just go for it!"
Soumya Deyasi,Sound quality is awsome,5,Good
Mukesh Gupta,"Basic grade headphone, Nothing existing",3,"As claimed by boat, it's has 7.1 channel surround sound. That you can only feel on packaging box, not in headphone.RGB lights are not as it is as showing in product page, it's just basic lighting, not impressive.Sound quality is just ok, but if you have good music test and knowledge about sound, it will definitely disappoint you.Loudness is missing, base is not up to the mark. sometimes it will feels like cheap headphone.Mic recording is just ok, you can't expect premium sound quality.  It's do not records sound as it is. Feels artificial sound mixture.Noise cancelation not yet checkedDriver Software for this headphone is just good for nothing. It's only for volume up-down.Mic is not detachable, cable also you can't detach.Cable quality is strong.Headphone design is awesome and looks like premium headphone.For playing games it works fine.It's good for gaming, but don't consider this for musicAs per my opinion it could be even better"
Abhilash Upadhya K,Efficient but bulky,4,The headphones work fine no issues no defects but its too heavy . There is a the volume control 'knob' but a mute button is missing on the device. The wire length is of good size and the overall device is versatile for use
Deven Abhyankar,Top class product.,5,"Sound clarity is best. Surround sound 7.1 sounds great, mic notice cancellation is good other people did not noticed fan running on full spin & air conditioner sound.The RGB colour lighting on headphones looks beautiful.Headphones built quality is top class & fitting is great.I found it slightly heavy on head & it creates vacuum in ear so not good for long gaming like more than 3 hours.Headphones fitting tightly on the ears I wished it could be little soft on ears.I love this headset & even though I told some things I do not like yet I am loving this headphones & I would recommend it to anyone."
Abdulrahman,Awesome headphone,5,"One of the best headphone, sound quality is awesome, mic also awesome for office use it reduce fully background noise, we can able to use for phone also by connecting OTG. I get it only for 999/-."

john,Great for gaming,4,"This product could take some time to get used to, but it's totally worth it. This headset is purely built for gaming alone. Wouldn't recommend for music. If you are a gamer go for it."
MaXimof KIRA,Durable at first glance,4,"At first glance headphone seems to be made of durabale material(i.e plastic&leather padding).Sound quality seems to be nice if not better than that.Fully braided cable and fancy gaming USB port is the best thing i like about it.Comfort is up to the mark, ear cups are softer then expected and ear cups cover entire ear.Padding at top distributes all the weight over your head making it feel light on the ear, making it usable for long hours. RGB adds a gaming vibe and is like cherry on top.Currently i am exploring the boat plugin labs and it is exciting to see that you can adjust the sound quality up to your subjective needs though its nice.It can also connect to mobile through otg port."
Amazon Customer,Satisfied,4,Bass is good. But we cant hear for long time as we feel heat in ears. For short time it is recommended

Saurav,Impressive,4,Product is impressive but 3.5 mm jack would be a plus point
SURESH KUMAR,Nice product. Excellent sound quality.,4,Nice product. Value for money. Excellent sound quality. Mic needs to be reset for quality.
Balakrishnan,Best MIC and worst MIC setup,4,"So the MIC quality is awesome, I bought this for WFH purpose. Gaming headset have good MIC so I prefer them for zoom/teams calling purpose. But the cosmic bytes not having quality MIC this one is excellent even under FAN it only catches my voice only.But the MIC is kinda loose if you adjust it and keep it near mouth in 10 secs it will go down so frequently you have to adjust it. They should have made this better more Regid once we adjust, it should stay in that position.A MIC switch would have made it better.They advertise Boat plugin software but I found it to be not useful."
Sahil Zedi,Premium sound quality for such low price.,5,Best gaming experience I've had so far with the sound quality this headset provides.Pros:1. Build Quality2. Premium Sound Quality3. Virtual Surround Sound4. Microphone is pretty good.5. Noise cancellation works pretty good.6. Dedicated BOAT Plugin application for management.7. Extra Loudness Lvl .Cons:1. Mic has to be close to mouth to work properly.2. Boat plugin application conflicts with sound drivers on some systems.

¬†These are the best gaming headphones for the pricePros :-1. 50 mm drivers sounds the best I've listened to other 50mm driver headphones and these sounds the loudest even at 70-75% you are good to go2. Top notch microphone sounds crystal clear and on top software customisation allows you to reduce background noice marginally3. Light weight at 380gm can't even feel they are on your head used them for almost 3 hours and no pain on ears at all although there is little sweating around ears but that's fine4. long 2m cable red colour braided looks awesome and feels durable and sturdy5. Software installation allows you to enable 7.1 surround sound there is slightly difference between normal and a 7.1 surround you can tell the sound where it's coming from marginally than normal stereo mode ( download software from bota immortal 200 page on boat official website of scan the QR code from mannual)6.Rgb looks sutel it has smooth breathing effect looks niceOverall great buy for 1499 I'll suggest go with boat rather than spending tom more for eksa e900"

Arka,Put it on baby!,5,So my previous headphone was destroyed for some xyz reasons and I bought this one cuz i was searching one on budget and then i got my hands on this beast. Even though the price is  low the 7.1 surround sound is hella segsy and provided ur a budget gamer like me this is a bliss and nevertheless a good choice for playing fps games for better sound and hearing but in the end the decision is yours.
Sharad S.,Superb headphone,5,Product is bigger than it seems in photos.Using this for WFH.Volume is excellent.There is a volume controller in headset itself.It is a plug and play device as PC USB automatically detects it and downloads required software.Brought it for Rs 999 only.
Yousuf,Good product,4,I liked the product. Bought it for meetings not for gaming. Only thing missing is button to mute. I have to do it manually through software. Overall good product

Sahithi,Hurts ears but good sound quality,3,"After trying the product for a month, I can tell that this is not a product if you have to wear it for long hours, my ears hurt. Headphones are very heavy. My advise is, if you don't use it for more than 2 hours at a stretch get them. I regret buying them, cause I need them for 8 to 10 hours and my ears hate having them on"
Sibsankar De,This headphone is very good for gamers as it has a wonderful and useful microphone.,4,This headphone is very good for gamers as it has a wonderful and useful microphone. It records voice in a beautiful way. In fan it can't record fan sound but records my sound. But one problem is that it cannot expand. Overall this is a very good headphone.
Harshil Chaudhary,Unbelievableü§©üëç,5,Expensive and value for money
Mukesh,The ear feel hot due to the ear cover,4,Ear covers are very big and air restricted so I feel very hot in my ear but sound and other quality is good.
Pankaj,A phenomenal 7.1Ch surround sound experience,5,"Initial impressions... The packaging is just phenomenal, I loved the way they've packed it, the unboxing experience was great.One of the best budget 7.1Ch headsets from a reputed brand. They're stylish and have a very neutral sound profile, well-suited for lots of audio content. While they lack more advanced sound modification options, its companion app does have a few EQ presets that you may tweak according to your preference.Despite the fact that these headphones have a very comfortable and stable fit, it will take you a day or two to get used to them. They're also well-made and have the sensation of a 7.1-channel headset. The cable is braided and pretty long. The noise-canceling is decent, and the RGB is permanently set to breathing mode. The microphone is omni-directional and of excellent quality; it also includes a small pop filter that greatly reduces wind noise.It's made of ABS and appears to be quite durable. Above the RGB lights, the metal mesh has been placed to give it a more robust appearance. The left earpiece has volume control.Overall, I think it's a great price; but, the software could have been better."
GURU prasad,My review,4,"I used this for a month till now its an amazing budget gaming headphone , but sometimes it creates pain around ears , except that its amazing budget gaming headphone"
Ananth,Great looking headphone for the price,4,"Its a good headset with great looks also but the image shown in the product section is a bit incorrect as there is a silver coloured grill over the boat logo, also the texture of the product is not same as the above-mentioned image. As for the comfort, my ears do have a bit of pain, maybe it might go after I get used to them. They have ok sound quality nothing spectacular but for the price i would say its good"
Pratham dave,Really Good in this price segment,5,"Around 1500 i guess this would one of the best headset in terms of build quality and overall feelThe headsets are really light as compared to other gaming headsetsThe earcup just over the ears really well,Audio profile is really sub-pa,r Bass is not that goodIf you compare this to the likes of Redgear Cosmos this doesn't have that thump, but the sound quality is really nice it has good vocals and sound seperation is really nice, 7.1 surrounding is a gimmick as of any budget 7.1 doesn't work till you use a sound card or a EQ.The mic is reasonably good but the sound isolation is excellent and the drivers provided gives so many features as we can polish the mic input sensitivity and the output volume which is A+.Overall a very good headphones around the price .And the biggest reason i bought this is because the brand quality of Boat itself as they provided some excellent customer service in the past , and i guess this is the best brand to buy gaming headphones at this price segment ."
Niraj,Amazing Gaming Headphone from boAt,5,"First of all on time Delivery and the packing was super cool .. About Headphone really was looking for budget and good headphone from long time and this Boat headphone is Super cool sound is damn nice and you can easily hear footsteps, the Rgb lights are also good it has 7.1 Surround sound ..Really good headphone in this budget just go for it ‚Ä¶."

¬†I purchased this a few months back but now it broke on its own it just came out literally nothing was done to it, I think I got a faulty product please help."
Meghalaya,worst mic attachement,3,"ive used it for around 10 hours and what i've found is the mic doesnot stay in the position where we set it. it goes away from the mouth in the opposite direction as if someone is pulling it. another con is that the ear muffs are rexin like material which makes you easily sweat within an hour of usage. n coming to sound quality the audio is quite loud but in terms of base its below average.there is no in line controller or any switch so that we could control the mic and rgb.its just bresthing rgb which is outdated in terms of looks.it feels quite heavy and the strap which comes over the head,it doesnot have enough strength to hold on and keep it in position. after 10 mins of usage the ear muffs are pushed down and taking support of my ears which is painful. for the price point its not so worth it. spend a bit more and go for redgear cosmo."
ATHARVA TANDEL,For the price of 1300 it is real good,5,It has real good stereo sound good for gaming. I play valorant now and then and the surround sound is quite clear. As for music not that great bass or maybe u haven't configured it yet but the treble and volume is more than enough at just 50 percent volume on windows. So that's great too
Deepesh Roy,Improve needed,3,"The comfort in the headphones are not good enough at the price range and the software functions are also not the best mic started glitching after a month , improve needed, but the costume service is perfect they replaced my product under warrant and fixed the mic issue"
Karthik,Value for money great built no compromise in the built quality.,4,Too much bass good for gaming the headset is not breathable ears starts sweating after an hour of usage. Sound quality is good for the price. Weight is a bit of a concern. I would recommend mid level gammer to use this to save some bucks.
Abhishek,Definitely worth buying,5,"The media could not be loaded.
                



¬†Bought this product for Rs1499/- and i'm pretty sure this headphone will give you an awsome experience in gaming.It looks quite bulky and attractive. Complete structure is made of metal and plastic. Headrest is of metal and headsupport is of leather.Earcups are very soft and as it is made of plastic so it will fell some sweaty in summers. It has boat logo(breathing RGB) on both sides and has metal grill o it.Has USB braided cable and cable is very long(2m).Weight is less (350gm) as compare to Redgear cosmo(600gm) but it will feel quite heavy on your ears after 2-3hrs.Sound quality is awsome(clear and sharp). But as it is a gaming headset it has balanced bass. 50mm drivers works perfectly in this headset.Mic quality is very good and has noise suppression on it.Don't forget to download it's software as it has many features like 7.1 surround sound, Environment effects, ENx Technology."
Poulami,May be nice. Haven't used it as it is for laptop only. Can't use in mobile phone. Hence returned.,4,For laptop only
Bharat Bhushan Jhariya,Price to performance,5,"I bought this product on 21st of September 2021 and I am highly satisfied with it. It has some really nice audio quality, noise cancellation and in my opinion one of the best gaming headphones in this budget. I have used plenty of gaming headsets and this one is my favourite for the budget. The mic quality is very good, and its good for gaming. If you listen to music very much, I will not recommend these for only music use still its average. Overall I love this hedset, its plug and play and I am very satisfied with it."
Sourav Goswami,Best USB Headphone for Linux üêß,5,"Best USB Headphone for Linux (using Kernel 5.15.8). The sound quality is amazing - all balanced sound. Bass is superb.Microphone quality is very good too! Not really noise cancelling, but it's appropriate for meetings in low noise areas!It uses the C-Media chipset for the USB DAC which isn't bad.The benefit of USB headphones is that it will sound the same on all devices that has USB and can provide the adequate power! So it doesn't rely on the integrated soundcard!Overall impressed. Got what I wanted!EDITWith USB OTG support, it also works on my phone (Kernel 5.14+). The sound is as usual very good quality!"

RAVI,The review u wanted!,5,"this is the review. the sound quality,the virtual surround sound and the mic..they are awesome...this headphone is worth for every bucks! sound is too loud on full volume and when u enable the 7.1 sound(first u need to install the boat plugin labz to enable it ) and if u a play a battle royale game..u can hear every footstep clearly and where is someone u can also detect it..so yh..and music listening..awesome and great..when u listen to music u wont be able to hear anything from outside of u hear..so go for these headphones!!!"
aman,Ok ok in price range but with a catch,2,"First of all it has wired usb port so only for pc and laptops not for cellphone. Now coming to the pc ...when you use it for voice over during video editing there is high eco in voice over audio specially in premiere pro so for mic purpose ""just waste of money"" for me.

Vector Sd,Good quality üòä,5,"I bought this for meeting purpose. I was looking for an overhead headphone with mic. COSMIC-BYTE was an option. But the built quality of COSMIC-BYTE is very poor. So I opted for this BOAT 200.PROS:1. Good sound quality2. Good bass3. Mic quality amazing4. Built quality is premium5. Wire quality is good (Braided & tnagle resistant)6. RGB looks goodCONS:1. A bit heavier2. sweats the ear quite often3. Only USB connection.(No 3.5mm - use OTG for mobile usage)Thats all. Overall I think it is a worthy purchase. (8.5/10)Although, I am dissatisfied with the delivery. The package was terribly crushed & broken. Very poorly handled. The box was opened in all sides & torned. Product is good üëç. Delivery is terribly bad üëé."

Anindya,Best gaming headphone under 4k!,5,"I tried other local gaming headphones but non were good since they all gocused on bass insted of clarity , which is an exceptionally bad idea when playing any multiplayer game.This has almost similar clarity as jbl quantum 200 for less then half the price. Which is exceptionally good. The mic is also similarly very clear and crisp.If u are considering for gaming i strongly recommend this one over boat im1000d or any other headphone."

Sanjeet chowdhury,VERY LOW BASS( made for footsteps),3,"Bought these cause of the BOAT brand, but the bass quality is so low that it can't even cross my boat wireless headphones in comparison, and mic is also NOT NOISE CANCELLING, the EDX technology that comes with there driver is essentialy useless, If you are looking for a headphone to improve game performance and hear footsteps and stuff like that, then these are the BEST but, if you want an overall experience where you use it for calls and sometimes music, NOT RECOMMENDED, these can be called ONLY GAMING HEADPHONES."
Chayan saraswat,Fantastic,5,No 1 quality
Sohan Pal,Mic is top quality,5,"Good gaming headphones in this budget. Looks good, not too heavy, easy on the ear. Best thing is the Mic.

Sahil Bansode,Overall good not for music lovers,4,This has no bass. Good for gaming. Microphone is good.
Karan,Just like every other headphone out there,3,"The size of the headphones is quite large, and it doesn't offer any clamping pressure whatsoever. The ear cups are so large that you can forget about passive notice cancellation. The mic is mounted on a clumsy support and will never stay at one place. Overall fit and ergonomics are below average.They perform well while gaming, sound separation is good, but the plugin you'll have to install is utter trash."
Madhu,Best headphones,5,This Boat product is amazing... One of the best headphones for this prize ... Totally worth it .... The noise cancellation is good enough and the audio quality is just on point ... The cushion is perfect and is soft on the ears ... The headphones looks heavy but it is really light in weight ... The RGB light also adds a cool effect ....and the mic is amazing and the wind reduction on the mic is descent. Definitely go for it

This was my first time having an ""over-ear headphone"", so I was taken aback by how my ears didn't even touch my ear and it didn't hurt at all.

In a room with very loud cooler running and the receiver doesn't even hear a noise or any sort of disturbance. Very comfortable for gaming sessions. Best value for your money.

The headphone seem to be working fine although hoping that they do not malfunction anytime soon given that it was in this dented box. Contents inside the box were given appropriately. As for the headphone, itself can't comment much about it as of now, although the initial sound quality check I performed gave good results..."

Madhusudan Giri,Worth the money it costs!,5,"The audio quality is good and mic cancels unwanted noice nicely, probably the best 7.1 headphone for gaming at this price point and also the driver offers many amazing features like live voice changer. Great product!"
Ratna Prakash,‚ùå Poor Build Quality ‚ùå,1,Don't ever purchase this headphone. Build quality is extremely poor. It's not worth the money. For the price they sell we expect a much better quality product but what we receive is a low quality product which hardly lasts a year

Viper X,Not for gaming,1,"No loudness equalisation option, bullets are loud af, footsteps are suppressed. May be all 7.1 headphones have the same issue.Updated: most trash part is the mic, very annoying structure."
Dipanshu Pimplikar,Recieved damaged/used product.,1,"The media could not be loaded.
                



¬†Recieved box was pretty damaged, tapes all around and main thing is that there were three to four layers of cello tape instead of product seal, opened the box to check whether the product is good or not. Got more disappointed as I saw the product full of dust and inner cardboards damaged."

Placeholder,Ultimate.,5,"Loved it! The sound quality of this Boat headphone is great, and mic is also very clear but the sound is just ultimate with ultimate bass."
Monish Goutham,Too big ear cups,4,The Ear cups are too big actually and because of that the noice cancellation is reduced...apart from that its great
Vikram,Boat Head phone,4,Sound is not sooo good quality but ok due to the very big hear pods sound quality is missing and seems to very big size. But overall product is not good at this price.
Rahul,Best budget gaming headphone,4,I am not an expert in technical stuff but i found this headphone quite useful in games. Sound and mic quality is also decent. There is a voice changer option in the boat plug in software which i really liked.1 thing that i don't like in this headphone is mic cable management. It is really hard to adjust the mic in the desired position.
Pradeep,Very good in this price segment,4,Very good in this price segment
Shushrut G.,Great quality headset but comes with a cost,4,"This headphone is great for a price of rs1200. Mic quality is good, speaker quality is great. But as I said this comes with a cost, that is wearing this for a long time is causing hair fall and baldness, which I suppose is a genuine problem with all over-ear and on-ear headphones.Better buy in-ear if you intend to use headphone/earphones for work or long gaming sessions."
Adithya,Don‚Äôt get fooled in the Q/A It works with Consoles too,5,
V3NK@T35H,Volume roker on the headphone.,5,I recieved the product on time and at approx. Rs.1300-1400/- . First impressions were excellent. No one told me that there is a volume rocker on the headphone. Knew it after a day. !! One day of low sound !! Ewww.
gururaj,Worth for what you pay.,4,"For the brand name Boat, I bought it.1. Built quality is superb. Feels heavy and good.2. Max sound will completely cut off you from the world.3. For those who had used Sony-like brands, Bass quality feels normal. It doesn't mean it has bad bass. It's good.4. Breathing LED gives it an extra muscle  Overall Worth for what you pay.About packaging, good. But felt like someone tried to see what's inside ( clearly someone tried to get it whatever inside if possible.) These days it's often happening in Amazon packing. Check it before you pay."
